# Editorial de Letras

## General idea.

Editorial de Letras is an open-access nonprofit independent publisher of literature in Spanish. It seeks to build an intuitive website and digital archive to make Spanish literature in the public domain freely available to everyone who has internet connection, as well as occasionally publish original commissioned or submitted texts. This publishing house also has an editorial standard defined by a board which associate authors who wish to publish with the organization must comply to since said standard will be the differential factor between the House and current online publishers.

This house only publishes transcriptions of the public domain or original texts by agreement with the author.
 
Regarding original texts, this publishing house distinguishes between submissions and the much rarer commissions. Submissions follow a pay-to-publish model only after they have been accepted by the editorial board and commented by anonymous reviewers. Submissions are free but publishing is not since editors and reviewers must be payed. Commissions are texts whose author, usually a renowned one, is paid to write an original non-fiction essay.

Before submitting a text, the participant must verify which kind of texts are accepted. Submitted texts must follow the guidelines.

While the publishing house receives submissions from anyone, it will only accept those submissions that show good writing and original ideas through fiction. Accepted submissions will be tagged as "Candidates" and these will receive full professional editorial services such as stylistic correction and formatting to make it publishable online under the highest standars in the Spanish language. Authors of accepted submissions (Candidates) must only pay for said editorial services. Accepted submissions automatically enter a yearly contest.

All published texts by this house are done so under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

## Programming needs to fulfill the general idea.

- Build an easy-to-use and intuitive archive which lets the user find certain text by author, title, theme, year or directly typing keywords on a searchbar.
- A single webpage for every book published on the website. A single webpage must organize the text in an "article way", with a table of contents at the side, it must support hyperlinks and footnotes and maybe hypermedia, comments at the margin and paragrap numbers also at the margin. Buttons which let them download the text in EPUB, MOBID and PDF formats. Ideally, webpages should be similar to these projects: [Example 1](https://practicaltypography.com/), [Example 2](https://chs.harvard.edu/chapter/acknowledgments-6/), [Example 3](https://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/01.html).
- Build a program which looks inside submitted PDF files and approve or reject them automatically based on whether they follow the submission guidelines or not.
